I've played (And used to love) Everquest, Asheron's Call, TFC (But not TF2), Borderlands, Oblivion + Morrowind + Fallout 3 (All feel so dead with poor art direction to me, but are fun for awhile), Amnesia (Such an unnerving game), Wurm Online (Gets way too grindy with such an awful.... Everything), and the list goes on... Can't think of much else that really \"defines\" me or my taste in gaming.  I'm looking for some type of game to kill time until 11/11/11 (Sorry for using DD/MM/YY, I just prefer it), and honestly I think I may want that game to be an MMO, a free to play MMO. I've been playing around with Champion's Online and it's not awful, but it's not really all that great either. I also have been **trying** to get into Forsaken World, but it's so poorly done that I just can't force myself into it. Maybe MMOs are too cookie cutter, trying to become carbon copies of WoW - forgetting what made people love them to begin with - for me to bother... So any type of game advice is welcome. Although if you agree with that statement and are currently enjoying an MMO, please do share.  Anyways, I found that this sub-reddit just opened and decided to be the first poster... I'll be sticking around and probably offering up some advice for games if anyone else posts in the near future. Also a tip for the mods: The description is a little confusing, it starts off \"To give advice on games\" - making it seem like you are meant to make posts supporting one game or another, but the description ends with \"you want helpful suggestions on\" - which is what I took from the description, but it feels contradictory What's the point of that?\"\n# Call the stream function with the loaded model and tokenizer\nprint(stream(user_prompt, model, tokenizer))\n\n\n#","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-10T09:35:59.142361Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-10T09:35:59.142713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-10T09:36:15.406754Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-10T09:35:59.142686Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-10T09:36:15.405806Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.\nA decoder-only architecture is being used, but right-padding was detected!
